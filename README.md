**Tab Inspector Google Chrome Extension Recieved By Flask App**

In this project, `main.py` sets up a headless flask API that can recieve post requests from a tab inspecting chrome extensions

The extension, housed under the `extension` dir is code copied from the google chrome documentation:
- https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions

The plan now is to dive into all the informations inside `windows_and_tabs_manager.js` and see what we can collect
